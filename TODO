+ is any api requests or backend 
| end

> course is published on admin dashboard
- user sees course on the courses catalog
> user clicks on course

- user decides they want to take it
> user clicks on enroll button
+ enroll button runs a function to create a checkout
+ a secure paypal checkout with designated price and product name gets generated 
- user sees paypal payment portal
